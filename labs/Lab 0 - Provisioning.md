# Lab 0 - Provisioning

We are going to set up a DataStax Enterprise (DSE) cluster on Azure.  If you do not have an Azure account, you'll need to signup for one or request access from your company.  Azure offers a [$200 free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/) to new users.  Note that if you use a free trial you will be subject to a low core quota that restricts how many machines you can spin up.

Please complete this lab prior to the day of the event.  This lab should take less than half an hour to complete.  If you have questions, contact your Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect (CSA), Data Solution Architect (DSA) or [ben.lackey@datastax.com](mailto:ben.lackey@datastax.com)

First off, open up a web browser and go to [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com).  This is the new Azure portal.  It replaces an older portal that Microsoft is deprecating.  Do not use the older portal for these labs.
